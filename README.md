# Hi, I'm Martijn Theeuwen
As an ICT student at Zuyd University of Applied Sciences, I have developed a strong interest in data, cybersecurity, and statistical analysis. I am most passionate about working on projects where multiple disciplines come together.

I enjoy variety, love learning new things, and thrive in collaborative environments where we can build something to be genuinely proud of. Driven by curiosity and perseverance, I continuously work on improving myself and actively contribute to the success of the team.
